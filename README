Small script to utilize public school list from http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp and to figure out a rough idea of where the school zones are
It should be noted that the polygons created are squares and that this data could very well be wrong.

You may run this script via: "ruby school_zones.rb pubschls.txt"
